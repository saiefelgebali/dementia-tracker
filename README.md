# Dementia Patient Tracking System

This is a system designed to be used for tracking dementia patients. 

There are two types of users, patients and nurses.

A nurse can create a group of patients using a web interface, and track their locations. Each patient's location is tracked by an arduino that is paired to a mobile application. 

## Technology used

Backend server: [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/).

Web interface: [SolidJS](https://www.solidjs.com/).

Mobile application: [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/).
